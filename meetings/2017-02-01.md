## Notes
#### [Hardening Production Server Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127YQAiU-id3UDj7j8PMbRj0G5JV1wAbXzTk3zcfFo5E/edit#heading=h.wbqtxpgioqy4)
* Instead of asking someone to write the whole document start with a skeleton that can be added incrementally
* Discussed a few key points and thought it would make it more approachable
* Utilizing either a gist or scripts within the custom_scripts folder to illustrate how to accomplish this key points
* An example from Discovery Garden:  [secure_drupal_file.sh](https://github.com/discoverygarden/secure_drupal_file/blob/master/secure_drupal_file.sh)
  * The code should be accompanied by comments explaining what the code is doing, why it's doing it and where to get more information.
  * The hope was for someone to do a PR to this script with the needed comments.
  * An example should be made in the [sample_scripts](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-Security-Interest-Group/tree/main/security_docs/sample_scripts) folder
* Ed offered to talk about [OWASP Dependency Check](Ed: http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/thereport.html) next month.
