* Nothing

## Next meeting
October 4th, 2017 2PM EST 

## Notes
* Google Chrome 62 release seems to have very little impact to the user experience (with the Islandora stack) and should not actually block any content.
* Link to an example page of http mismatched: [http://http-password.badssl.com/](http://http-password.badssl.com/)
* Ideal approach to address GhostScript for Islandora would be to test on vagrant updating drush commands for the PDF solution pack to include a test (determine which version) and set the switches accordingly.
* Cropbox may complicate the solution or have no effect at all.
* Cropbox testing failed and may have been caused by the GhostScript version (speculating)
* Fagan Inspection should be brought up during the next meeting.
* Include some popular alternatives that have very little impact on the community if possible.
