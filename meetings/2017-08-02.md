## Notes:

islandora/theme/islandora-objects.tpl.php
* Discussed whether if a **t()** should be used even if the output is from a trusted source. Example: **<?php print $pager; ?>**

[islandora_xml_forms/elements/templates/Tabs.tpl.php](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_xml_forms/blob/7.x/elements/templates/Tabs.tpl.php#L31)
* A code security scanner suggested replacing the double quotes with the html equivalent and/or wrapping in a htmlelement()
* '<?php print "#$link" ?>'
* '<?php print &#39;#$link&#39; ?>'
* No opinion was strongly expressed by the group

[islandora_scholar/modules/bibliography/islandora_bibliography.module](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_scholar/blob/7.x/modules/bibliography/islandora_bibliography.module#L294)

* PHP suggest against using the unserialization() on untrusted data.
* [http://php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php](http://php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php)
* This would be defensive programming and could contribute to the coding guide
* Requesting that the programmer add a comment above the function and discuss why it wasn't sanitized
* This would also make the entire stack more consistent
* Is there a good reason why not to standardize this?
* Possibly another function call. This might be a performance issue for edge cases.
* We don't really stick anything in the DOM as a result of getting the unserialized PID could get something malicious, but then we try to load it as a fedora object, get nothing back, and then nothing is added to the DOM.

[https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-1535](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-1535)

* Going to bring up at next committer's call

[https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-1807](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-1807)

* Possible solution

[https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories/blob/7.x/.travis.yml](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories/blob/7.x/.travis.yml)
* Suggested should close won't fix. Been kinda fixed already and was addressed in the way of excluding some tests for older versions

[https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-1873](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-1873)
* Needs to be tested
* Rosie offered to test
* Batch is async and pages start first before book object is created
* Idea is to explicitly add that POLICY to page level before book is made plus check the parent during preprocessing, see if the policy is supposed to cascade, stash the results, and use them during processing

[https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-1572](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-1572)
* Bring it up with committers call
* Next Meeting: September 6th, 2017 2PM EST
