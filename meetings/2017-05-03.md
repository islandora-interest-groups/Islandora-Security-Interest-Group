## Notes
* Code review is One way it is useful: We get to share our knowledge
  * Making Islandora better / more secure but expanding our collective knowledge, contextual concerns could approach the maintainers to start the conversation.
  * Use Google Docs as a way to show a history of the reviews
    * Do not post them in the IG wiki
  * Take notes of patterns that will help for programmer
    * Make automated tools to identify patterns
  * What's Next list and solutions?
    * Jonathan Green: A suggestion for a place to dig into code would be derivative generation functions. I know we are paranoid about shell escaping, but if there were a place I think we had a vulnerability it would be shell injection
