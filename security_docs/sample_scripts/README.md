These are scripts referenced by documents from the security_docs folder. The documents can point to either a script within this folder, a gist or a host script on a web site.

## How to create a script to put here
To post a script here create a script based on the __template_scripts.sh__ file (this is optional but might help to get started). This file has examples of how to comment on you code and other simple ways to standardize your example.

**Any one of these scripts can be run like this**
```terminal
 $ bash template_scripts.sh
```

If you're submitting a new file to this folder to be published make sure you make it executable.

**Here's how**
```terminal
 $ chmod +x template_scripts.sh
```
You might need to use sudo in front of it `sudo chmod +x template_scripts.sh`
